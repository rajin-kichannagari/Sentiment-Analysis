## Introduction

The Social Media Sentiment Analyzer is a Python project that allows you to analyze the sentiment of text data, such as social media posts or user-generated content. It utilizes pre-trained language models and natural language processing techniques to determine the sentiment of the text as either positive, negative, or neutral.

## Project Overview

This project provides a command-line interface (CLI) for sentiment analysis. Users can input text, and the program will analyze the sentiment and provide confidence scores for each sentiment label. The sentiment analysis is performed using the Hugging Face Transformers library, which leverages state-of-the-art models for text classification tasks.

## Features

- Sentiment analysis of text data.
- Support for positive, negative, and neutral sentiment labels.
- Confidence scores for sentiment predictions.
- Modular code structure for easy extension and customization.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Before running the Social Media Sentiment Analyzer, ensure you have the following prerequisites installed:

- Python 3.x
- Required libraries (install using `pip`):
  - `transformers`
  - `nltk`
  - Deep learning framework (either TensorFlow or PyTorch)
 
### Installation

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:
   git clone https://github.com/rajin-kichannagari/Sentiment-Analysis.git


2. Navigate to the project directory:
cd social-media-sentiment-analyzer

3. Install the required Python libraries:
pip install transformers nltk
 
4. Install TensorFlow or PyTorch based on your preference:
	pip install tensorflow 
	or 
	pip install torch

## Usage

To analyze the sentiment of text data, follow these steps:

1. Prepare a text file containing the text data you want to analyze. Each line of the file should contain a single piece of text (e.g., a social media post).

2. Place the text file in the `data/` directory of the project.

3. Run the sentiment analysis program:

   python main.py

4. The program will analyze each line of text in the file and provide sentiment labels and confidence scores.


## Advanced Configuration

- **Custom Models**: You can specify a custom sentiment analysis model by modifying the `analyze_sentiment` function in `models/advanced_sentiment_model.py`.

- **User Interface**: If you want to create a graphical user interface (GUI) for this project, you can explore libraries like `tkinter` for building a user-friendly interface.
